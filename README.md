<h2 id="Age"  > The start of time </h2>
<p> According to Greek Mythology , there were 4 ages before the gods . The fourth age was entierly ruled by the Titans also known as the Golden Age .
Ouranus (First Lord of Sky) and Gaia (Mother Earth) gave birth to 12 children . The race of these children were called the <strong> Titans </strong> 
Before the Titans  . Ouranus and Gaia ruled . Ouranus controlled the sky and Gaia the Earth . 
The most evil of the Titans was Kronos (also known as Cronus ) He was convinced by Gaia (who wanted her children to rule ) to overthrow his father but Ouranus was immortal and so were the Titans as they were children of two immortals and whenever two immortals have a child the child will be immortal and so on .  Oranus was also <strong> first god of the sky </strong> The sky was his domain of power . Kronos convinced four titans :<strong> Krios , Koios , Ipaetos , Hyperion</strong> to join him . He promised them that once he was king he would give them the 4 corners of the Earth : North (Koios got that direction) , South (Krios got this one) , West (Ipaetos or Ipaetus got this one) and East (Hyperion got this direction ) . Since the five titans knew that Ouranus was unbeatable in the sky they convinced him to come down to Earth away from his <strong> domain of power .</strong> Once he came down , the other 4 Titans ambushed and held him to the ground holding his legs so that he can't go back to the sky . Ouranus struggled and struggled against the 4 Titans . Meanwhile , Kronos picked up his father's scythe which was on the ground . 
He cut his own father with his own  scythe . Even though Ouranus didn't die he was cut into pieces by Kronos . Kronos shattered his father's remains into an ocean . And proclaimed himself the king .

<h3 id="Midas"> The Golden Age</h3>
<p> After Ouranus was overthrown , gradually Kronos become the king of the Titans . His reign was called the Golden Age also known as the fourth age . Even though Kronos was evil and all he wanted was power the reason his reign was called the Golden age is because the Titans were very rich during this age and they had a lot of resources . But humans (known as mortals by gods and titans) and <a href="#demigods">demigods</a> were mistreated . There were many titans during that era and the Titan of the  Ocean was Oceanus . Kronos married Rhea another immortal and gave birth to six children in the following order : <a href="##Hestia">Hestia </a>, <a href="##Demeter">Demeter</a> , <a href="#Hera">Hera</a> , <a href="#Hades">Hades</a> ,<a href="#Horses"> Poseidon </a>and <a href="#Zeus">Zeus</a> . <br> 
<h3 id="Titan"> The First Titan War</h3>
<p>
Soon after the birth of Kronos's children who were the <a href="#Poseidon">gods</a> by the way . Kronos became paranoid that his immortal children will overthrow him like he had done to his father , Ouranus 	. He wasn't sure what to do , he couldn't kill his children as they were immortal so he ate all 5 of his children when they were just infants . However , his wife Rhea hid baby <a href="#Zeus">Zeus</a> and gave Kronos a rock to eat instead . Since the five gods devoured by Kronos were immortal  they remained undigested in the titan's stomach and practically grew up there . Later when <a href="#Zeus">Zeus</a> grew up , he fed Kronos a mixture of mustard and wine which made him disorge (barf) his other children whereseas <a href="#Zeus">Zeus</a>'s brothers and sisters out . Then after all brothers and sisters were united there was a war between the gods and the titans . This battle went on for 10 years amongst the Titans and their supporters on one side and the Olympians and their allies . This conflict is also known as the Titanomachy . The Titans were based at Mount Othrys . Finally , the war ended in victory for Olympians when <a href="#Zeus">Zeus</a> cut his father into pieces like Kronos had done to Ouranus . The damaged was restored and the Golden Age was over .
</p>

<h3 id="infants"> Punishment of the Titans</h3>
<p> Kronos's remains were shattered into Tatarus , the darkest part of the Underworld . And <a href="#Zeus">Zeus</a> was declared the king of the Olympians . The other Titans were immortal but were captured and weakened and were given endless punishment . For example , the Titan of Fire 'Prometheus' was given one of the worst punishments . He was chained near a mountain and every day an eagle (the symbol of Zeus ) would come and eat his liver . This causes Promethus a lot of pain . But since he's immortal he can't die so his liver grows back the next the eagle comes again and does the same thing . And so on for the rest of enternity . The only Titan who wasn't punished was Rhea , the Queen of the Titans . Becuase she had helped the Gods in the Titan War and had also hid <a href="Zeus">Zeus </a> from Kronos . Even though she wasn't she wasn't punished rather rewarded . She disappeared herself never to be seen again . Many believe the Queen of Titans is still out there just not showing herself . The other Titans were sent to Tatarus where Kronos's remains lied as well . They were trapped their for enternity , too .</p>
<h3 id="Giant"> The First Giant War </h3>
<p> After the defeat of the Titans , Gaia was furious at the Olympians (her grandchildren) for throwing her beloved children . So she had a new race of children with the spirit of the pit of Tatarus . She gave birth to the first race of giants . All the giants were born with powers to kill a specific god .

<table align="center" class="toccolours" style="margin: 1em auto; clear: both;">
	 There were different fates of all giants . An important thing to remember is that where there is good there is bad . Simiraly , where there is bad there is good . In the giants , Damasen was born to oppose Ares , the War God . So since he is the opposite of war a.k.a Ares he was born peaceful and helpful . He  spent his life in the mortal world living as a farmer. 
One day, a drakon appeared in the mortal world and killed one of Damasen's farmer friends. In a rage, Damasen tracked down the drakon and killed it. He was condemned to Tartarus for slaying the drakon, which was ravaging the mortal world. In Tartarus, Damasen was constantly attacked by the drakon he destroyed in the mortal world. Every "day", the drakon regenerated and attacked again. Eventually, he built himself a hut out of the drakon's bones and skin. The best giant suffered the worst fate . 
	


<p id="Hera"> The race of Giants had been born and <strong> the First Giant War</strong> erupted when Porphyrion kidnapped <a href="#Hera">Hera</a> (The Queen of the Olympians and wife of Zeus ) .  The only way to <em> kill a giant </em> is if a god and demigod work together . After Hera's kidnap , Porphyion attacked Olympus (palace of the Olympians where they have meetings ) The Fates (these are three old ladies who decide everyone's fate or future ) told Zeus that the Olympians could not defeat the giants without the help of a lion-skinned-mortal, <a href="#Zeus">Zeus</a>decided that this must mean his famous demigod son <strong> Hercules</strong> and he sent Athena (his daughter ) to find him . Hercules defeated Alyconeous (Bane of Hades ) . Alyconeous had a power that he couldn't be killed in his homeland or where he was born . His homeland was Pallene . So , Hercules defeated and killed him outside Pallene's borders . He had the help of <a href="#Zeus">Zeus</a> and together the god and demigod killed Alyconeous . While the King of Giants was also killed by Hercules and Zeus . While Clytius (born to oppose Hecate)  was killed when his head was set on fire by Hecate using torches . <strong> Fire was the weakness of Clytius .</strong> While as we know Damasen was banished to Tatarus by Gaia and his siblings .  Enceladus (born to oppose Athena) was killed under a mountain by Athena . Ephilates and Otis were killed by Dionysus (who was first a demigod during that but was later made a god ) and Artemis (Goddess of Hunt) . <a href="#Artemis">Artemis</a> tricked both of them into fighting and killing each other . Thoon was killed by the Fates using bronze clubs . Hippolytos was  killed by Hermes, who was  wearing an invisibility cap.
Mimas was  killed by Hephaestus with a volley of molten iron.
Polybotes was  crushed by Poseidon beneath the island of Nisyros.  Orion (born to oppose Apollo and Artemis ) did not participate in the First Giant War .
And Periboia (born to oppose Aphrodite : The Goddess of Love )  was the only female giant among them . She was eventually killed by combined efforts of Hercules and Aphrodite . Finally , the first Giant War was over . </p>


<h3 id="Apollo"> Demigods</h3>
<p> When a god and mortal have a child . <em>he or she</em> is known as a <strong>demigod</strong> meaning (half-human and half-god ) . A demigod has powers he/she has obtained from their godly parent but they don't have all the powers their parents have . <em> especially</em> the power of <strong>immortality </strong> Demigods are very much mortal they can die the same way a normal human does . The only thing that differentiates them for mortals is their powers . These demigods are usually dyslexic . They can't read english but since one of their parent is an Ancient Greek God they can read Greek easily . They often are known as <em>heroes</em> as they are the one who kill monsters . Many renowed heroes like Hercules , Perseus and Theseus are also demigods .</p>
